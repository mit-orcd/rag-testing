The Lustre scratch space will be faster than NFS for the majority of workloads, however having large numbers of small files will make it slower than NFS and can slow down the filesystem overall, so it is important to follow the Lustre Best Practices.

Individual and group storage use and quotas can been viewed on the User Profile Page on the SuperCloud Web Portal (only accessible if you have an account). Additional storage may be granted on a case by case basis.
