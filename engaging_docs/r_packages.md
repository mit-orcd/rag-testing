R PackagesInstalling R packages local to your /home directoryTo install R packages, first you must have an R module loaded with the command:module load R/[version]Then, create a local directory where your R packages will live. We suggest using something like:/home/[user]/R/libsNext, you will need to create a file in your /home/[user] directory called.Renviron. This file will tell R where to look for your local packages. You will need to add the following line to this .Renviron file:R_LIBS_USER="/home/[user]/R/libsOnce this file is present in your /home/[user]/ directory, you will be able to install R packages from the command line with the command:install.packages("[R_Package_Name]")If you have any questions or problems installing R packages, please emailorcd-help-engaging@mit.edu2.
