Python PackagesInstalling Python Packages Locally with PipPython packages, such as Numpy, pandas, or matplotlib, must be installed on a user by user basis. This process assumes that you have loaded a Python module with the commandmodule load python/[version]. As python is included in anaconda, using an anaconda module will work too.You can install python packages with the command:pip install --user [package_name]Please note that you MUST use the –user flag, otherwise you will get a permissions error since it will try to install the python package across the cluster instead of for just your user account.If you have any questions or problems installing python packages, please emailorcd-help-engaging@mit.edu1.
