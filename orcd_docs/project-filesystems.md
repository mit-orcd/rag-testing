Additional project and lab storage can be purchased on ORCD shared clusters by individual
PI groups. This storage is mounted on the cluster and access to the storage is managed 
by the group through MIT Web Moira (see below for details).

The current options for storage are:

Please note that all types of storage are not backed up by default.

Storage is charged at the start of each fiscal year. The first year is prorated by the number of months left in the current fiscal year. A purchase must be a minimum of 20 TiB and in increments of 20 TiB.

If you anticipate needing more than a few 100 TiB let us know when you request your storage. We may suggest purchasing a dedicated server for your lab.

For more information, including pricing, and to purchase storage please send an email to orcd-help@mit.edu. If you are purchasing storage please include the following in your request:

Individual group storage is configured so that access is limited to a set
of accounts belonging to a web moira list that is defined for the group
store. The owner and administrators of group storage can manage
access themselves, by modifying the membership of an associated moira list
under https://groups.mit.edu/webmoira/list/[list_name]. The name of the
list corresponds to the UNIX group name associated with the ORCD shared 
cluster storage.

The figure below shows a screenshot of the web moira management page at
https://groups.mit.edu/webmoira/list/cnh_research_computing for a hypothetical
storage group named cnh_research_computing. The interface provides a 
self-service mechanism for controlling access to any storage belonging to
this group. MIT account IDs can be added and 
removed as needed from this list by the storage access administrators.
